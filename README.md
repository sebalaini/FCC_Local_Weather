A local weather website that provide the local API based on the geolocalization. Project for FreeCodeCamp.

# Know Issue

It doesn't work on a live page due to HTTPS request, on PC you have to accept to "load the unsafe script" and then the browser ask you permission to "know your location", allow and the website work fine. 
You can download it and open from local, in this way it work without problem.
